This unique, mini barrel holds 3 liters and is handcrafted with wood from a real Kentucky bourbon barrel. You can use the barrel as a piece of decor or as a decanter -- but the real fun is using it to blend your own custom batch of bourbon. No experience is needed because each barrel comes with its own set of detailed guidelines for use.\n\n- No extra charge for engraving\n- Measures 8.5&quot; x 5.5&quot; x 5.5&quot;\n- Steel hoops wrap the barrel (your choice of silver or black)\n- Comes with hand carved wooden stand.\n- Detailed instructions for use included.\n- Wood sourced from authentic KY bourbon barrels (American White Oak)\n\n------------------------------\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n------------------------------\nThe process is very simple. Before the barrel&#39;s first use, you&#39;ll have to perform the curing (cleaning) it. The included instructions will thoroughly explain how to do this. It&#39;s very easy. Once the barrel is cured, fill it with your favorite whiskey or bourbon. For extra flavor, add extra ingredients like cinnamon sticks, apple chips, honey and chocolate. After this, it&#39;s up to you to determine how long you let everything sit (I recommend a taste test every week to get it just right). Once you&#39;ve finished one batch, you can empty your creation into a decanter and restart the process. If you&#39;re not a big whiskey drinker, you can also use the barrels to blend or store your own wine, rum and tequila. \n\n------------------------------\nENGRAVING OPTIONS\n------------------------------\nI will engrave the front of your barrel(s) at no extra cost. There is a visual example of the 4 engraving style in the product images above. Please select the engraving style you want from the drop down box above. Your options are are:\n1. Standard Initials\n2. Monogram (small first name initial, large last name initial, small middle name initial)\n3. One or Two Custom Lines of Text (max of 15 characters per line)\n4. Single Large Initial\n\n*You can also select blank and not have any engraving on the barrel.\n** Please note that &quot;standard initials&quot; and &quot;monogram&quot; aren&#39;t the same thing.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nHOW TO SEND ME YOUR ENGRAVING REQUEST(S)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease select the engraving style you want from the drop down box above. When finalizing your order, you&#39;ll have the ability to include a &quot;message to seller&quot;. Use this area to tell me what you want engraved on your barrel(s). If I don&#39;t receive a message with your engraving request, it will be assumed you want your barrel to arrive without engraving.\n\n--------------\nSHIPMENT\n--------------\nOrders are currently shipping out  approximately 4-6 business days after you order. After this, there are another 2-4 business days in transit via UPS Ground.  If you need a rush order, please contact me BEFORE ORDERING to discuss available options.\n\n------------------------------\nSHOP POLICIES & FAQ\n------------------------------\nFor answers to common questions on this product, shipping timeframes, refunds and other details, please consult with this page: http:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/themanregistry\/policy","creation_tsz":1457540297,"ending_tsz":1468077497,"original_creation_tsz":1342221630,"last_modified_tsz":1457540297,"price":"77.95","currency_code":"USD","quantity":8,"tags":["groomsmen gifts","gifts for groomsmen","gifts for men","bourbon barrel","holiday gifts","birthday gift men","mini whiskey barrel","groomsmen gift","groomsmen","guys","men","Gift Ideas","Father's Day Gift"],"category_path":["Weddings"],"category_path_ids":[68887494],"materials":["Wood","Steel","Oak","Bourbon Barrel"],"shop_section_id":17061130,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1449694884,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/104334149\/3-liter-engraved-bourbon-barrel-great?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":29366,"num_favorers":1745,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":4,"processing_max":6,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":"men","occasion":"christmas","style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1668,"taxonomy_path":["Weddings","Gifts & Mementos","Groomsmen Gifts"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":429848403,"hex_code":"C29F85","red":194,"green":159,"blue":133,"hue":26,"saturation":31,"brightness":76,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1361401516,"listing_id":104334149,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/010\/0\/6661096\/il_75x75.429848403_3on6.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/010\/0\/6661096\/il_170x135.429848403_3on6.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/010\/0\/6661096\/il_570xN.429848403_3on6.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/010\/0\/6661096\/il_fullxfull.429848403_3on6.jpg","full_height":533,"full_width":800},{"listing_image_id":445440670,"hex_code":"AEA192","red":174,"green":161,"blue":146,"hue":32,"saturation":16,"brightness":68,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1365110039,"listing_id":104334149,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/016\/0\/6661096\/il_75x75.445440670_k0bx.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/016\/0\/6661096\/il_170x135.445440670_k0bx.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/016\/0\/6661096\/il_570xN.445440670_k0bx.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/016\/0\/6661096\/il_fullxfull.445440670_k0bx.jpg","full_height":425,"full_width":500},{"listing_image_id":429849335,"hex_code":"BB977B","red":187,"green":151,"blue":123,"hue":26,"saturation":34,"brightness":73,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1361401516,"listing_id":104334149,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/012\/0\/6661096\/il_75x75.429849335_76hf.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/012\/0\/6661096\/il_170x135.429849335_76hf.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/012\/0\/6661096\/il_570xN.429849335_76hf.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/012\/0\/6661096\/il_fullxfull.429849335_76hf.jpg","full_height":533,"full_width":800},{"listing_image_id":429849817,"hex_code":"AF9786","red":175,"green":151,"blue":134,"hue":25,"saturation":23,"brightness":68,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1361401516,"listing_id":104334149,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/013\/0\/6661096\/il_75x75.429849817_fgco.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/013\/0\/6661096\/il_170x135.429849817_fgco.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/013\/0\/6661096\/il_570xN.429849817_fgco.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/013\/0\/6661096\/il_fullxfull.429849817_fgco.jpg","full_height":768,"full_width":511},{"listing_image_id":429878570,"hex_code":"BA987B","red":186,"green":152,"blue":123,"hue":28,"saturation":33,"brightness":72,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1361406787,"listing_id":104334149,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/014\/0\/6661096\/il_75x75.429878570_8tiu.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/014\/0\/6661096\/il_170x135.429878570_8tiu.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/014\/0\/6661096\/il_570xN.429878570_8tiu.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/014\/0\/6661096\/il_fullxfull.429878570_8tiu.jpg","full_height":533,"full_width":800}],"Shop":{"shop_id":6661096,"shop_name":"themanregistry","user_id":18469439,"creation_tsz":1323887568,"title":"Handmade Gifts for Grooms, Groomsmen & Beyond","announcement":"Free personalization on all orders.

Please message me for details.\r\n\r\nQ - Do you guarantee the lead and ship times listed above.\r\nA - I never guarantee a delivery date when an item ships via UPS Ground. This is because the activity on UPS&#39; end is out of my hands. If you need an item by a specific date, please contact me to discuss guaranteed options. We may need to add a rush to the order and use a shipping method quicker than Ground.\r\n\r\nQ - What is rush service and how much is it?\r\nA - Rush service cuts down the lead time for an order. Instead of the stated lead time for a product, the order will go out sooner with a rush. The fee for this is $20 due to the expedited work that has to be done on my end. Please contact me  BEFORE ORDERING to discuss placing a rush order.\r\n\r\nQ - How do I send you my personalization request(s)?\r\nA - Great question. If you&#39;re ordering an item that can be engraved or personalized in any way, please create a &quot;message to seller&quot; while checking out. You can write your personalization requests in this message. If I don&#39;t receive this message, it will be assumed you don&#39;t want any personalization for your order.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\nCARD HOLDER BARREL FAQ\r\n==========================\r\nQ - How many cards will the barrel hold\r\nA - We estimate that it will hold 100-125. Keep in mind that not all guests will give cards. If the barrel start to fill up, it&#39;s easy to remove cards.\r\n\r\nQ - How big is the card slot?\r\nA - The card slot is 6\u201d long and approximately 1\u201d wide.\r\n\r\n======================\r\nBOURBON BARREL FAQ\r\n======================\r\nQ - I just received my barrel but the hoops are loose. What do I do?\r\nA - This is normal. Once the barrel is cured, it will expanding thus tightening the hoops. Detailed instructions for curing are included with every barrel.\r\n\r\nQ - Does my barrel need to be used immediately?\r\nA - No. But we do recommend using it within the first two months. After two months, an un-cured barrel can start to all apart due to drying out.\r\n\r\nQ - Why does my barrel look slightly different from the ones in the product photos? OR I ordered several barrels and they all look slightly similar.\r\nA - Since no two pieces of wood are exactly alike, no two barrels will be exactly alike. The varying grain level and thickness of wood gives each barrel it&#39;s own unique, charming look.\r\n\r\nQ - What engraving font do you use on the barrels?\r\nA - Times New Roman Bold.\r\n\r\nQ - Can my engraving be done curved around the top and bottom of the barrel face?\r\nA - Unfortunately, not. The only engraving formats I&#39;m set up to do are listed on the product listing and featured in the product images.\r\n\r\nQ - Are the barrels charred?\r\nA - Yes, the barrels are charred with a medium level (2-3) char.\r\n\r\nQ - My barrel is leaking, what should I do?\r\nA - It&#39;s normal for a barrel that hasn&#39;t been cured to leak. Before using the barrel, you must first seal it by following the curing process that&#39;s detailed in the included instructions.\r\n\r\nQ - Is there a limit to how many times the barrel can be filled?\r\nA - The barrel can be filled an unlimited number of times. For the purposes of aging your own spirit blends, you&#39;ll get the best results from the first four fills.\r\n\r\nQ - I filled my barrel but now it&#39;s empty!?!? What happened?\r\nA - Either someone in your home has been sneaking drinks OR you didn&#39;t fill the barrel all the way up as the instructions say to. If you don&#39;t fill the barrel all the way up, the top will get dry and evaporation will occur.\r\n\r\nQ - Why did my barrel turn a weird bluish looking color after curing it?\r\nA - This happens in less than 1% of barrels. The cause is related to the the ions in water negatively reacting to the metal thus the black bleeding onto the barrel.  There is no health risk, but please contact me if this occurs. \r\n\r\n=====================\r\nOAK BARREL MUG FAQ\r\n=====================\r\nQ - Are the mugs toasted?\r\nA - Yes, they are lightly toasted.\r\n\r\nQ - Why is my mug leaking?\r\nA - As stated on the product listing, you must cure the mug before use. Curing instructions are included with each mug. If you&#39;ve misplaced yours,  you can do the following: fill the mug with hot water and keep it filled for two days until it stops leaking, or until you don&#39;t see the water level change after 24 hours.\r\n\r\nQ - Can the mugs be engraved?\r\nA - Unfortunately, my equipment isn&#39;t set up to engrave the barrel mugs. My suggestion is to make your purchase and have them engraved locally.\r\n\r\nQ - How do I clean my mug between uses?\r\nA - You can hand wash the mugs with warm water and perfume-free dish detergent.\r\n\r\n=======================\r\nCHALKBOARD MUG FAQ\r\n=======================\r\nQ - If I  buy a chalkboard mug, can you write a message on it for me?\r\nA - We&#39;ve attempted to include chalk-written messages on mugs in the past, but the writing does smudge during shipping. We&#39;re happy to try -- but we think it&#39;s going to look much better if it arrives blank vs. being smudged up.","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1455230563,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/themanregistry?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/053\/0\/6661096\/iusb_760x100.14676080_r5qu.jpg","num_favorers":864,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/073\/0\/6661096\/isla_fullxfull.15875080_mbmu6dc7.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":false,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":false,"has_unstructured_policies":true}},{"listing_id":267066648,"state":"active","user_id":81670612,"category_id":69150425,"title":"Stillwater College Town Rocks Glass Set","description":"How About Those Pokes!

Please remember that each item is customized to your specifications and therefore take a little time to create.\r\n\r\n2. I need my items quicker then the processing time offered is this possible?\r\n\r\nYes! Rush processing is available however there will be an extra fee involved. Rush processing fee is based on the number of items, weight of items, where the items will be shipped to, and how quickly those items are needed. All rush processes are &quot;after hours.&quot; No item will reserve priority over another and all items all processed in the order that they are received.

USPS website states the following for shipping in the 48 USA:\r\nAll items under 13 oz 2-5 days\r\nAll other items 2-9 days\r\nPriority items 2-3 days\r\nUSPS Shipping outside the USA:\r\nFirst Class Mail 5-16 Business Days\r\nPriority Mail 6-10 Business Days\r\nExpress Mail 3-5 Business Days\r\n\r\n**ALL customs can stop and hold packages for any amount of time and is not covered by shipping times\r\n\r\n5. I am a foreign buyer, what fee will be associated with my package? \r\n\r\nAll countries have their own fee associated with packages being mailed in from a foreign buyer.  Please contact the appropriate government agency to find out what your fees will be.  All packages will be marked as goods sold without exception.  All fees relating to the package within the buyers country will be the responsibility of the buyer.\r\n\r\n6. Do you accept returns?\r\n\r\nNo returns will be accepted on any personalized items.  Do to the customization of the items they can not be resold to another customer and therefore all sales on these items are finial.\r\n\r\n7. Do you accept cancellations on your items?\r\n\r\nCancellations on items will be accepted within a 24 hour time period as long as the item has not been currently worked on or in production. Currently worked on or in production items also includes any custom items that included mock ups\/proofs. Due to the time constants of mock ups\/proofs these items are considered &quot;in production&quot; and cannot be canceled once started. All items that have not been started but are passed the 24 hour time limit will be given as credit of funds towards the shop for a future purchase within 265 day from original purchase date.\r\n \r\n8. Can I change what I want on my items?\r\n\r\nAs long as your product is not in production we will except changes to your item within a reasonable time frame. If we have a question about your item and what you want engraved we will contact you immediately. If we do not hear back from you within 24 hours we will move forward, if possible, on your item using the setup or style that you chose.\r\nFor example-If you choose a monogram style engraving and you give initials and you do not respond to an email for clarification on your engraving within 24 hours your item will move into production using the monogrammed style you chose.\r\n\r\n9. Do you do proofs\/mock ups\/pictures of your items?\r\n\r\nDue to work load I do not do proofs\/mock ups\/pictures of items at no cost, doing so would add a 2-4 day extra processing time for all items. The reason is every day I get 25-50 requests for such items, the average mock up\/picture takes 5-20 minutes a piece resulting in 2-17 hours a day. If you would like a proof\/mock up\/picture of your item an extra $5 charge will be added onto your item cost per proof needed.\r\n\r\n10. For custom Images:\r\n\r\nAll images need to be in a vector style format as well as black and white.  A vector image is made up of paths not of pixels which results in clean lines that the laser can read. Any none vector image (.jpg for example) shows pixels which the laser will pick up and engrave onto your objects resulting in an image that will look blurry. The acceptable vector formats are: .ai, .cdr, .eps. Please note that most .png images will not be acceptable. \r\nIf you have an image that is not a vector format such as a .jpg  that you would like to use I can either have a graphic artist trace it out for you at a cost of $25-$50 or you can go to a site such as www.vectormagic.com  where you can sign up for free and get multiple conversions into a vector image. If you go this route I would need the .eps file that you download from the site.\r\nThe cost of a custom item after the black and white vector is received varies on the size of the image and the item the image is to be engraved on. Cost range from $2.50 per item to $40 for large items. If you are looking for multiple items for a company or another occasion discounts for large quantity orders will be given.\r\nAll vector images need to be sent to Kate@KustomProductsInc.com because Etsy does not currently support vector style uploads.\r\n\r\n11. I am purchasing this item as a gift, how will they know who it is from?\r\n\r\nI will exclude all receipts\/payment information for all packages so the receiver does not know the cost of their gift. I would also be happy to include a note from you so they know who the gift is from. As Etsy currently does not have an option to add information for a gift and I do not wish to charge you for that service by creating a new listing please just add what you would like the message to say in the notes section during your checkout.\r\n\r\n12. Why are the silver flasks more expensive then the other flasks?\r\n\r\nThe silver flasks cost more then the other flasks due to production costs. In order to produce the mark on a silver flask a marking agent must be used. The marking agent is a very expensive spray that reacts with the heat of the laser.  After the marking agent is placed the item that is being marked the item must be marked at a high heat and at a very low speed that takes 4 times longer then other similar items.\r\n\r\n13. LAYAWAY: I know that wedding budgeting can be tricky and sometime it is just easier to pay a few payments then one lump sum. For that reason layaway will now be available on purchases of $250 or more.  Please read the following rules carefully:\r\n-Layaway is for purchases of $250 or more. If you would like layaway on a purchase less then this please contact me and I will see if something can be arranged.\r\n-A 10% layaway fee will be added to the cost of your order. For a $250 order this would be $25.\r\n-Layaway payments can be made by credit card via Etsy and\/or PayPal. No checks or money orders will be accepted.\r\n-There will be no refunds of money for any lawaway purchases. All money that is currently paid to the shop can be used as shop credit only minus the layaway fee.\r\n-1\/3 is due on purchase, 1\/3 in 30 days, and the balance in 60 days\r\n","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1453221268,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/KustomProducts?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/029\/0\/8619330\/iusb_760x100.12691977_k44j.jpg","num_favorers":676,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/121\/0\/8619330\/isla_fullxfull.17819240_cq9lugms.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":false,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":false,"has_unstructured_policies":true}},{"listing_id":239537391,"state":"active","user_id":8368399,"category_id":69150425,"title":"Birdseye Maple and Stainless Steel Bottle Stopper","description":"Birdseye Maple and stainless steel wine stopper.

The pen tip features a relief cut scroll engraving of an authentic trophy deer mount. The rustically antiqued plating brings out all the wonderful details of the engraved design. The design emulates the type of engraved game scene scroll work found on real and highly sought after bolt-action rifles, and capped off the deer themed design with a deer mount pen clip with a sight scope. The body and bolt action mechanism is the same as you will find in my original Bolt Action pens. Plus, with its rich, warm copper finish and dark antique highlights, the details of this pen will surely impress. The body of my pen is Marker&#39;s Mark authentic whiskey barrel Oak Wood. These charred barrels were used to age the whiskey to perfection. The barrels were only used once in the aging process. \n\nThis is turned on my lathe and completed with a smooth hand rubbed finish. My pen comes with a gift box and a Certificate of Authenticity for the pen and a Certificate of Authenticity for the Maker&#39;s Mark Oak Wood.\nAll my products are hand made and no two items are alike.

Sorry, screen printed apparel, towels, and totes can\u2019t be customized because of the complicated process involved in making them.\r\n\r\nIf you require a digital proof of your customized item, I must receive your payment before sending the proof. I will edit the design as many times as you&#39;d like until it&#39;s exactly the way you want it. If you are absolutely not happy, I will refund your payment minus a $10-$20 design fee.\r\n\r\nSorry, I no longer offer completely custom designs from scratch. Please choose one of my existing items to customize.\r\n\r\nPROCESS\r\nPaper items are printed in house on a professional ink jet printer at the highest quality setting. Paper items are cut, folded, and packaged by hand. Paper items are printed to order.\r\n\r\nAll screen printed apparel, totes, and towels are hand pulled by me. Screen printing is the least perfect method I use, so some variation will occur. All screen printed items listed in my shop are already  made and ready to ship.\r\n\r\nFabric magnets and ornaments are designed and assembled by me. The fabric is printed by a business in North Carolina. The fabric is stocked in my studio, but the magnets and ornaments are assembled to order.\r\n\r\nSHOP LOCAL\r\nPlease check my list of stockists to shop my products locally:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.meghanmccrary.com\/#!stockists\/c4lu\r\n\r\nWHOLESALE\r\nI am on Etsy Wholesale! You can also contact me for a list of wholesale prices if you are a retailer interested in carrying my products.\r\n\r\nQUALITY\r\nI take pride in the quality of my work. I check every product before packaging it. Because the quality of the product is more important to me than creating products cheaply and quickly, some orders may take longer for me to produce (especially wholesale orders). I carefully choose the highest quality papers and apparel. All of the paper I use is acid and lignen free. I try to use eco friendly products as much as possible. &quot;Natural&quot; paper products are 100% post-consumer waste, and &quot;natural&quot; towels are not chemically processed, color treated, or bleached. All apparel is made in the USA by companies with strict labor regulations. \r\n\r\nVARIATIONS\r\nColors always vary between computer monitors and printers. I try my best to represent colors truly, but some variation may occur. Everything in my store is handmade, and some variations in size, color, and print job will occur.\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT\r\nAll designs in my shop are original and copyrighted. Please do not use my photographs without consent.","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1453917948,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/shopMeghanMcCrary?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/055\/0\/6073301\/iusb_760x100.14971093_6iuj.jpg","num_favorers":1359,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/072\/0\/6073301\/isla_fullxfull.15932486_njdrdpuw.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":false,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":false,"has_unstructured_policies":true}},{"listing_id":271488176,"state":"active","user_id":45181326,"category_id":68891034,"title":"JIM BEAM DECANTER: Cobalt Blue, Bonded Beam, Kentucky Bourbon Whiskey","description":"This cobalt blue bonded whiskey decanter was once filled with\n8 year-old Jim Beam Bourbon.

Formed into balls they are then dipped in my homemade white, milk or 80% dark chocolate. Finishing this delightful treat off is crumbled hickory smoked bacon.  \n\n(Finishing will be small slabs of bacon, crumbles are becoming to dry during shipping. Picture will be up dated asap) \n\nThese bourbon balls are very strong and for adults only.

CHECK YOUR SPAM FOLDER \r\n\r\nNote: 95% of the time orders placed by Thursday are delivered by that following Friday.

This effort not only moves us closer to some of our suppliers, but also allows us to ship international orders to Australia, Singapore, Japan, etc. including much of Europe, South America... cheaper and faster. \r\n\r\nNorth American customers, mainly USA and Canada, will not be affected by this addition, for you good folks, it&#39;s business as usual: engraved and shipped from Houston, Texas. Yee Haw!\r\n\r\nThis concept looked good on paper, let&#39;s hope it pays off- wish us luck!\r\n\r\nLastly, for items with multiple colors, for example journals, since our suppliers cannot keep accurate stock levels, we may substitute your purchase with the same product in a different stocked color. \r\n  \r\nImportant Notes:\r\n\r\n*Expedited orders, large orders or orders with not stock in the USA will come from our Hong Kong shop. We reserve the right to ship from either shops. \r\n\r\n*Ordering samples before a large order is prudent; however owing to the nature of our business, we cannot guarantee a sample and the final production will look &quot;exactly&quot; alike as we have different machinist and many machines that all engrave \/ print slightly different. If getting &quot;exact&quot; is critical, please let us know at order so we can find the previous order documents and make sure we use the same machinist to engrave the order. We may request a visual photo of the sample for a final reference.   \r\n","policy_seller_info":"PO Box 1538\r\nFresno, TX 77545\r\n1-800-925-7044","policy_updated_tsz":1455255726,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/TealsPrairie?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/030\/0\/8057725\/iusb_760x100.14286491_ae7v.jpg","num_favorers":21609,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":null,"is_using_structured_policies":false,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":false,"has_unstructured_policies":true}},{"listing_id":111635920,"state":"active","user_id":16281365,"category_id":68930904,"title":"LSW Girls Sexy GOT WHISKEY Original Bootie Shorts-Boxer brief-Biker babe-rocker chic-Bridal-bridesmaids gifts-Trademark Clothing line","description":"Original Got whiskey  Bootie Short.\n\nBlack with White writing.\nCuper comfy Soft cotton stretch with Satin Trim.\n\nTrue to size, these are quality fabrics.

The use over the years has given such personality to this awesome jug!! Believed to be from the era of the 1920&#39;s, this jug has some interesting features as a result of manufacturing.  As you can see from the photos, some of the glaze actually missed areas of the jug due to a small clump of clay and a natural dent that you can see in photo which caused that area to not get fully glazed.  All of these features give this piece so much personality of being a functional jug used for molasses....whiskey? !!!  As is noted in the 4th picture there is a chip on the lid, which is actually about 1\/2&quot; in diameter.  This awesome piece measures 10&quot; high x 8&quot; in diameter. Please note that all of the items in our shop are from our family, some pieces were resurrected from our centennial farm.  Needless to say we will take great care to carefully package this family treasure, so that you may enjoy this fine piece for years to come.\n\nShipping Policies: costs vary so greatly based on location, weight, etc. that of late we have been pricing it out from the ETSY calculator, using our own boxes, for priority mail.

This prescription was the second of five, issued by the Treasury Department during the Prohibition, and was used for a short period of time! Please see photos!\n\nFrom the days of Al Capone, flappers and moonshine this was the only legal way to drink liquor in the US!\n\nThe whiskey was prescribed for Daniel Dougherty, by Dr. James A. Morganstern,  on October 13,  1922, and was filled on October 14, 1922, by Pharmacist, Ralph Rapp, of Rapp&#39;s Drug Store, in Easton, PA.  It was issued by the Treasury Department and printed on pale blue paper with large Treasury Seals. When you hold this prescription up to the light PROHIBITION is watermarked, as with the metal strips that are used in U.S. bills today. \n\nThe prescription measures 6 1\/2&quot; x 4 3\/4&quot;, has folds, wrinkles and a piece off one corner, otherwise, condition is corner...a great script!\n\nThis is a fantastic piece of history and would be great to display in a pharmacy, doctor&#39;s office, museum, bar or office! I am happy to answer any questions, please feel free to email, thanks!","creation_tsz":1457537859,"ending_tsz":1468075059,"original_creation_tsz":1446565068,"last_modified_tsz":1457537859,"price":"25.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["medicine","pharmacy","bar","us currency","whiskey","man cave","distillery","doctor","Prohibition whiskey","antique whiskey","vintage whiskey","antique doctor","old pharmacist"],"category_path":["Paper Goods","Scrapbooking","Ephemera"],"category_path_ids":[69150367,68889914,68907410],"materials":["treasury department paper"],"shop_section_id":null,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1446565068,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/254512045\/antique-1014-1922-prohibition-irish?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":62,"num_favorers":4,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":null,"processing_max":null,"who_made":"someone_else","is_supply":"false","when_made":"1920s","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":2779,"taxonomy_path":["Paper & Party Supplies","Paper","Paper Ephemera"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":861491777,"hex_code":"DAD4C9","red":218,"green":212,"blue":201,"hue":39,"saturation":7,"brightness":85,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1446565069,"listing_id":254512045,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/109\/0\/6057601\/il_75x75.861491777_h5ew.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/109\/0\/6057601\/il_170x135.861491777_h5ew.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/109\/0\/6057601\/il_570xN.861491777_h5ew.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/109\/0\/6057601\/il_fullxfull.861491777_h5ew.jpg","full_height":986,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":861725948,"hex_code":"D0CDC4","red":208,"green":205,"blue":196,"hue":45,"saturation":5,"brightness":81,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1446565069,"listing_id":254512045,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/115\/0\/6057601\/il_75x75.861725948_1fgb.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/115\/0\/6057601\/il_170x135.861725948_1fgb.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/115\/0\/6057601\/il_570xN.861725948_1fgb.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/115\/0\/6057601\/il_fullxfull.861725948_1fgb.jpg","full_height":846,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":861726502,"hex_code":"DAD4C9","red":218,"green":212,"blue":201,"hue":39,"saturation":7,"brightness":85,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1446565069,"listing_id":254512045,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/112\/0\/6057601\/il_75x75.861726502_945p.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/112\/0\/6057601\/il_170x135.861726502_945p.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/112\/0\/6057601\/il_570xN.861726502_945p.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/112\/0\/6057601\/il_fullxfull.861726502_945p.jpg","full_height":986,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":6057601,"shop_name":"ProhibitionWhiskey","user_id":11371431,"creation_tsz":1287322223,"title":"Prohibition Whiskey Prescriptions Opium Moonshine Forms","announcement":"Welcome, please have a sip of whiskey, relax and enjoy a fine selection of US Government issued Prohibition prescriptions, Opium narcotic forms and Moonshine liquor dealer tax stamps.
